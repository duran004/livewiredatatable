# LiveWireDatatable
The goal of this project is to create a datatable with laravel's advanced features without using the classic javascript datatable library. And it's like live! Because livewire!

## Usage
1- Download package with composer in your laravel project.
2- Use in any view with @livewire('livewire-data-table', ['model' => App\Models\Users::class])

## Still Beta!
Be careful when using it, it is still in beta.
